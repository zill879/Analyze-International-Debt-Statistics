# Analyze-International-Debt-Statistics
In this  I use the World bank data set to find out which country has highest debt ,common indicator and many more
In this project, you will be examining data related to the debt accumulated by developing countries, which is provided by The World Bank. This dataset includes information on the debt amounts, measured in USD, across various categories. The objective is to address several key questions:

1. What is the total debt owed by the countries in the dataset?
2. Which country has the highest debt amount, and what is that specific amount?
3. What is the average debt amount for countries based on different debt indicators?

Essentially, you'll be exploring international debt statistics to gain insights into the overall debt burden of these nations, identify the country with the highest debt, and analyze average debt figures based on various debt indicators. This analysis is crucial for understanding how countries manage their economies and address infrastructure needs, among other factors, through borrowing from international organizations like The World Bank.
